In order to run the following model you will need Netlogo V 4.0 or later. 

NetLogo v5.3.1. https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/5.3.1/ 

   It's important to download this version; it
   appears to be the most recent environment that will work
   with Mark P's code. The good news is that you can install
   multiple versions of NetLogo side by side, and pick
   whichever one you need at runtime.

Once NetLogo v5.3.1. is installed, to start the model click the LiquidityModel file. 
For instruction on how to operate the program please see the infomation tab within netlogo.
To use the default settings: 1. click the SetUp Model button; 2. click the go button.
