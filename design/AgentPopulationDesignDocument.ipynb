    "## AgentPopulation\n",
    "\n",
    "This proposal for `AgentPopulation` takes into consideration many desiderata for HAM modeling that have arisen in previous iterations of implementation of HARK, Econ-ARK's pioneering HAM toolkit. It also is explicitly driven by the use case of the _Understanding Financial Markets_ project, originally funded by the Sloan Foundation and pending further finanical support. This latter use case involves the integration of HAM agents with a separate ABM representing financial markets, which greatly complicates the ability of the HAM model to represent agents with rational expectations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This proposal envisions the `AgentPopulation` class to be developed in several stages, initially with a \"lightweight\" version that supports integration with external ABMs with relaxed rational expectations conditions, and ultimately building to a more fully-powered macroeconomic modeling tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "### True distribution of population parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "This software class, provisionally named `AgentPopulation`, represents a population of macroeconomic e.g. consumer agents who individually vary over a distribution of parameters. For example, the agents within the population may vary with respect to their impatience, risk aversion, income shocks, and expectations of a risky asset's return values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optional/separate approximation parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "The discretization parameters of the distributions and the size/shape of the grids for value interpretation should be defined separately from the \"true\" distributions in order to enable comparison of different approximations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fitting population parameters to empirical distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "Extend CSTWMPC methods to enable fitting of population parameters so that outcome dependent variables (such as distribution of wealth) resemble empirical values.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Population Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond the grounding `AgentPopulation` class, there will also need to be a more general `PopulationSolution` class that represents a solution or policy that is parameterized over the variety within the population. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Hierarchical interpolation grids\n",
    "\n",
    "This solution object will range over additional \"grids\" of inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "These will be hierarchical: inputs that vary with respect to the agent's population parameters will be treated differently than those that vary with endogenous population state.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Economy Aggregator\n",
    "\n",
    "There will also ultimately be a new class to support the derivation of rational expectations of an `AgentPopulation` as they interact in the aggregate with \"economy\"-level phenomena. This would be a variation of what is currently called (somewhat confusingly) a `Market` in HARK."
