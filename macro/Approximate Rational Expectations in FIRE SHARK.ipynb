    "In the FIRE SHARK model, there are three parameters that are set before the execution of the model:\n",
    " - $\\mu_u$ and $\\sigma_u$, the mean and standard deviation of the lognormal distribution that his the HARK agent's _expectation_ of the market returns under usual conditions.\n",
    " - $\\zeta$, a sensitivity value which determines how unlikely observed market returns must be for agents to doubt their _usual_ expectations and begin to adopt _strange_ beliefs based on recent price history. If $\\zeta = 0$ the agents never adjust their expectations. It higher levels of $\\zeta$ they are more willing to change beliefs.\n",

    "### Dependence on $\\zeta$\n",
    "\n",
    "As part of the definition of the FIRE SHARK model, we defined $\\zeta$ as a threshold for agents to abandon their rational expectations because of unexpected market returns. When $\\zeta = 0$, the agents do not ever change their expectations from the values of $\\mu_u, \\sigma_u$.\n",

    "As $\\zeta$ is increased, the macroeconomic agents behave less predictably. However, in AREA1, $\\zeta$ does not get updated as a result of the simulation.\n",

    "In other words, under AREA1 the RE return statistics $(\\hat{\\mu}, \\hat{\\sigma})$ area function of $\\zeta$: $(\\hat{\\mu}, \\hat{\\sigma}) \\leftarrow \\text{AREA1}(\\zeta)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, $\\text{C-AREA1}$ is potentially a function of $\\zeta$. It may be possible that there is a fixed point if $\\zeta = 0$, and no fixed point, or a harder to find fixed point, for higher values of $\\zeta$.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Complication: Non-IID Returns\n",
    "\n",
    "The above analysis assumes:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Agents believe market returns are IID\n",
    " - Market returns are close enough to IID for there to be a convergence.\n",
    " \n",

    " - Agents interact with the market in ways that allow the possibilty of causal dependence\n",
    " - The Market has some amount of autocorrelation\n",
    " \n",
    "In other words, market results can be path-dependent. Suppose the market systematically diverged into one of two distributional modes with even probability. The computed $(\\mu_s, \\sigma_s)$ would combine the statistics of these two modes, but it would never be observed in practice, and so agents with positive $\\zeta$ would dwell in the \"strange\" belief state even if a fixed point existed for AREA1 convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Arguably:\n",
    " - This would not be true RE, because the agents would rarely believe ($\\mu_u, \\sigma_u$).\n",
    " - This would not be true RE, because the agents _shouldn't_ believe $\\mu_u$ and $\\sigma_u$. Rather, they should be using recent information to determine which mode the economy is in.\n",
    "     - CDC: The easiest thing to allow them to think about is _stochastic volatility_. Volatility facts are something they should match.\n",
    " - It is not clear how AREA1 would behave under this condition; $\\text{C-AREA1}$ might be very high."
